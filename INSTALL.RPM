===== Virtual Printer =====

This cups-pdf RPM is designed to create a Cups-PDF virtual printer
during the installation, but only if cups is running.

You can create the virtual pinter using :
    /@unixroot/usr/sbin/lpadmin -p Cups-PDF -v cups-pdf:/ -m CUPS-PDF.ppd -E

You can remove the virtual printer using
    /@unixroot/usr/sbin/lpadmin -x Cups-PDF
